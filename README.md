# AI Learning Notes

This repository records my learning process in data analysis, machine learning and AI development.

This mainly records engineering codes. The concepts and calculation principles of related algorithms are recorded separately, so they will not be explained in detail here. Instead, efforts are made to clearly connect the relationship between principles and engineering implementations for the convenience of reading.

## Structure
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for Python data analysis basics and ML basics. It also features documentation of key concepts and my own thinking processes on occasion.
- projects/: practice projects from courses and self-learning.


## Main environment
- Anaconda 24.11.3
- Python 3.10.19
- numpy 2.2.5
- pandas 2.3.3
- matplotlib 3.10.8
- seaborn 0.13.2
Unless otherwise specified in the README, this project mainly uses the above environment. For details, please refer to requirements.txt.
Tip: As long as your Python version is 3.10.19, in theory, if you use Anaconda Navigator to search for and install the packages used in the project, I think you should be able to directly run most of the content in the project.

## Notes
This repo is updated incrementally as I progress through different topics.

- **H**: Files marked with "H" at the end were difficult to complete at the time, and need to be reviewed to further understand and improve.
- **HS**: Files marked with "HS" mean the corresponding problems have been basically resolved.
- **HH**：Extremely complex and difficult


## Explanation
In this record, what I want to express simply and intuitively is generally in Chinese, which has a higher information density. However, for learning purposes, I will try to use some English nouns and phrases for annotation as much as possible.

If the content of a certain chapter in the notes folder is related to the project files, it will be recorded in the README file under that chapter's folder.


## Learning sequence
My relevant foundations before learning this content: basic data structures and algorithms, UE C++ development, and basic Python syntax.
Basic knowledge: Fundamentals of data analysis (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib) → Machine learning (classic algorithms of supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning neural networks) → Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow & Keras) → Large model development (LangChain, Web， Big data technology)
Project-oriented: Applications of deep learning in the fields of CV and NLP → Popular AI projects → AI large model application development
