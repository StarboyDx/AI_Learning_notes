# AI Learning Notes

This repository records my learning process in data analysis, machine learning and AI development.

This mainly records engineering codes. The concepts and calculation principles of related algorithms are recorded separately, so they will not be explained in detail here. Instead, efforts are made to clearly connect the relationship between principles and engineering implementations for the convenience of reading.

## Structure
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for Python data analysis basics and ML basics. It also features documentation of key concepts and my own thinking processes on occasion.
- projects/: practice projects from courses and self-learning.
- Note: If the content of a certain chapter in the notes folder is related to the project files, it will be recorded in the README file under that chapter's folder.

## Notes
This repo is updated incrementally as I progress through different topics.

- **H**: Files marked with "H" at the end were difficult to complete at the time, and need to be reviewed to further understand and improve.
- **HS**: Files marked with "HS" mean the corresponding problems have been basically resolved.
- **HH**：Extremely complex and difficult

## Explanation
In this record, what I want to express simply and intuitively is generally in Chinese, which has a higher information density. However, for learning purposes, I will try to use some English nouns and phrases for annotation as much as possible.
