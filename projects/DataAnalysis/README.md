# Overview
This is a basic data analysis practice project.
The background of this project is derived from a dataset of November sales of a beauty store during Tmall's Double 11 Shopping Festival, focusing on products, their sales volumes, and customer reviews. The dataset contains 7 features, enabling multi-dimensional text analysis. As it is real commercial data, anonymization has been performed to protect the store's privacy—all references to the store name in the dataset have been replaced with the product brand name.
Subsequent experiments will center on this beauty product dataset, involving data analysis, visual presentation, and ultimately delivering data analysis conclusions along with rationalized sales suggestions for the merchant

## Summary of Data Analysis
- In the beauty category, the sales volume of skin care products is much higher than that of cosmetics, among which basic skin care products such as cleansing products, 
  toners, and face creams have the highest sales volume;
- Men's purchases of beauty products are concentrated in skin care products, among which Nivea is the most popular brand among men;
- Price and popularity are related to sales volume, and affordable basic products are the choice of most consumers;
- Due to merchants' early warm-up for Double Eleven, the huge discounts and the desire to avoid network peaks, many consumers chose to consume in advance, resulting in a sales
  peak in the few days before Double Eleven; in the 3 days after Double Eleven, merchants continued to offer discounts, and consumers still had residual shopping enthusiasm, but it was far less than that before Double Eleven.
